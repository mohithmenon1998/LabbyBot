# LabbyBot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot designed to assist students with queries related to NCERT laboratory exams, practicals, and syllabus content.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a RAG architecture to provide accurate and context-aware answers. Instead of relying solely on a Large Language Model's internal knowledge, the bot retrieves relevant information from a dedicated knowledge base of NCERT practical guides before generating a response.

**Key Features:**

*   **Context-Aware Answers:** Provides specific answers based on official NCERT documentation.
*   **Structured Information Retrieval:** Efficiently searches through provided data files.
*   **Interactive Interface:** (Briefly mention your intended interface, e.g., "A simple Streamlit/Flask web interface.")
